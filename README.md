## Usage
This program greets the user and asks for their name. After recieving their name it asks them for their age. Once the program receives the age of the user it then calculates what the user's age is in dog years. It does this by taking their age and multiplying is by 7.

```python
name = input("Hello. What is your name?") #returns 'Hello, what is your name?''
print("Hi ", name, ', welcome!') #returns 'Hi, [name you inputted], welcome!'
```
